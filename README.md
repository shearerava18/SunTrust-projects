# SunTrust-projects
I had the priviledge of working with and learning from top talent this past summer at SunTrust as a Data & Analytics Management intern.
For three months, I worked with Corporate Treasury on data quality/assurance projects and assisted the Data & Analytics Office
in automating a portion of their data wrangling project for CCAR reports. 
My main project included the contents of the Program.sas file, which I now realize is a regrettably unimaginative name. This macro
was intended to automate their past data wrangling/ quality assurance procedures. Before, the data lake team would wrangle and ensure 
their data was clean by hand by using Excel, which would take about one week to complete. The SAS macro I wrote, with the guidance of my 
team and mentor, completes the entire project in about 10 minutes. In SAS EG, I used SQL to query the data to be verified and a series of macros to loop through every column in the datasets.
